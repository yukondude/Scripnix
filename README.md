# Scripnix
Useful Python3 and bash shell scripts for macOS/BSD and \*NIX. Useful to me, at any rate. YMMV.

Replaces the old [Scripnix0](https://github.com/yukondude/Scripnix0) project which had grown crufty and was not macOS-friendly.

## Motivation

Scripnix was born during my Linux server admin days when I wanted all of my aliases and scriplets to follow me from machine to machine.
Packaging everything together made installing and keeping up-to-date that much easier.
Writing it was also a bash scripting learning exercise, although I soon grew to loathe space-containing-filenames and all of the quoting that
implied.

As I moved more to MacOS, the BSD version of most commands clashed with the GNU/Linux versions that Scripnix assumed.
Still wanting those handy aliases and scriplets on MacOS, I resurrected Scripnix, but with many more of the commands written in Python, and
with Homebrew-supplied GNU versions of my favourite utilities.
The Python rewrite sidestepped much of the silly bash quoting and syntax, and made testing practical.

## Change Log

The current version is 0.1.12.
Scripnix is [semver](http://semver.org/)-ish in its versioning scheme.

Scripnix is currently an alpha release, so expect many many breaking changes.
Once ready for prime time, the major version number will jump to 2 to reflect that this is actually the second incarnation of Scripnix.

## Installation

Following installation using one of the methods below, you may also want to run the `install-scripnix` command as the root user to setup the
system-wide configuration.
Any other users that also wish to use Scripnix should also run that command.

The `install-scripnix` command will also suggest changes to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.profile` files to persist Scripnix in your environment.
It will also suggest changes to the `/etc/sudoers` file (vi `visudo`) so that the Scripnix commands can be run via `sudo` when necessary.

### Homebrew (macOS)

On macOS, Homebrew will take care of installing any dependencies, including Python 3.

    brew tap yukondude/tap
    brew install scripnix
    install-scripnix
    
### PyPI (POSIX)

On *NIX, you will first need to install Python 3.3 (or higher) using your preferred method.

    pip3 install scripnix
    install-scripnix
    
## Development Setup

 1. Install Scripnix, as above, so that all of its dependencies are available.
 1. Create a Python 3 virtualenv for Scripnix: `mkvirtualenv --python=$(which python3) Scripnix`
 1. Clone the Scripnix repo: `git clone https://github.com/yukondude/Scripnix.git`
 1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt -r requirements-test.txt`
 1. Install the project in development mode: `./setup.py develop`
 1. Run the unit tests to make sure everything is copacetic: `./setup.py test`
 1. Pour a snifter of Martell XO and light up a Bolivar Belicoso.

  command. Optionally, the results may be sorted (as well as possible) by
  the scheduled hour and minute.

  Must be run as the root user.

  -H, --no-header       Don't display the table header row.
  -r, --run-parts       Display commands in a run-parts target directory as if
                        they were individually scheduled.

  Per-user configuration settings, including for the root user, are stored
  under the ~/.scripnix/ directory and override the global settings. The
  installation can be re-run repeatedly, but will not overwrite existing
